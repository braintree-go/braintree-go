# How to Contribute

## Testing

The project is covered by a suite of unit tests.

## Submitting Changes

Please open a GitHub PR with a clear list of what you have done.
Please follow golang coding conventions.

Always write a clear description for the PR and mind the quality of your commits (small, descriptive and ordered commits).

#### Flow of a PR

- Contributors open a PR
- PR is reviewed, and maintainers give their +1
- Contributors merge the PR

**Big PRs will be rejected** Having multiple changes in the PR's description is a high indication that it should be broken into smaller PRs. (e.g This PR does X and Y -> PR for X and PR for Y).

## Deploying Your Changes

- **Do not** merge without our code review.
- Make sure your changes do not cause any new errors.
